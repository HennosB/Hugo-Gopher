Hi! My name is Hennos Berhane and I am an aspiring illustrator. I drew the Hugo Gopher for you to use in your websites, presentations, posts in blogs, social media, courses, videos, etc. They are licensed under [Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).
